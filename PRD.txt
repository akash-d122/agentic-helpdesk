Smart Helpdesk with Agentic Triage - Product Requirements Document
Version: 1.0
Date: August 2025
Document Owner: Product Team
Introduction & Background
The Smart Helpdesk with Agentic Triage is an end-to-end web application designed to automate and streamline customer support operations. The system leverages AI-powered agents to automatically classify, research, and respond to support tickets, reducing manual workload while maintaining high-quality customer service.
This solution addresses the growing need for efficient ticket management in customer support operations, where human agents are often overwhelmed with repetitive queries that could be automated while ensuring complex issues receive appropriate human attention.
Problem Statement
Organizations struggle with:

High volume of repetitive support tickets consuming agent time
Inconsistent response quality and timing across support interactions
Lack of efficient knowledge base utilization in ticket resolution
Poor visibility into support workflow efficiency and decision-making processes
Difficulty scaling support operations without proportional staff increases

Goals & Objectives
Primary Goals

Automate Routine Support: Reduce human agent workload by automatically resolving high-confidence tickets
Improve Response Consistency: Ensure all responses leverage the most relevant knowledge base articles
Enhance Operational Visibility: Provide complete audit trails and decision transparency
Scale Support Operations: Handle increased ticket volume without proportional staffing increases

Success Metrics

Reduction in average ticket resolution time
Increase in first-contact resolution rate
Improved customer satisfaction scores
Reduced manual agent workload on routine queries

Key Features & Requirements
Core Features
1. Multi-Role Authentication System

Purpose: Secure access control with role-based permissions
Roles: Admin, Support Agent, End User
Implementation: JWT-based authentication with role-based route protection

2. Knowledge Base Management

Purpose: Centralized repository of support articles for AI agent reference
Capabilities: CRUD operations, article status management (draft/published), tagging system
Access: Admin-only management with searchable interface

3. Ticket Lifecycle Management

Purpose: Complete ticket tracking from creation to resolution
Features: Ticket creation with attachments, status tracking, conversation threading
Statuses: Open → Triaged → Waiting Human → Resolved → Closed

4. Agentic Triage Workflow

Purpose: Automated ticket processing and response generation
Components:

Category classification (billing/tech/shipping/other)
Knowledge base article retrieval
Response drafting with citations
Confidence scoring and auto-resolution logic


Decision Logic: Auto-close if confidence ≥ threshold, otherwise assign to human

5. Agent Review Interface

Purpose: Human oversight and intervention for AI-generated responses
Capabilities: Review suggestions, edit drafts, manual assignment, status changes

6. Comprehensive Audit Logging

Purpose: Complete traceability of all system actions
Features: Trace ID consistency, timestamped events, actor identification
Visibility: Audit timeline accessible via UI

User Stories & Use Cases
End Users

Technical Architecture
System Components

Frontend: React + Vite with Tailwind CSS styling
Backend: Node.js/Express API server with MongoDB
AI Agent: Either Node-based or separate Python FastAPI service
Queue System: Redis-based job processing (optional)

Data Models

User: Authentication and role management
Article: Knowledge base content with metadata
Ticket: Support request lifecycle tracking
AgentSuggestion: AI-generated responses and decisions
AuditLog: Complete action history with trace IDs
Config: System-wide settings and thresholds

API Design
RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes:

Authentication: /api/auth/*
Knowledge Base: /api/kb/*
Tickets: /api/tickets/*
Agent Operations: /api/agent/*
Configuration: /api/config/*
Audit: /api/tickets/:id/audit

Non-Functional Requirements
Security

JWT authentication with token refresh
Input validation on all endpoints
Rate limiting on authentication and mutation endpoints
No sensitive data in logs or client responses

Reliability

Retry logic with exponential backoff for AI agent calls
Timeout handling for external service calls
Idempotency keys for critical operations

Performance

Response time targets: <200ms for API calls, <2s for AI processing
Concurrent user support for typical support team sizes
Efficient database queries with proper indexing

Observability

Structured JSON logging with trace IDs
Health check endpoints (/healthz, /readyz)
Request logging middleware with performance metrics

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (MVP Core)
Goal: Basic functional system with manual workflows

User authentication and role-based access
Basic ticket CRUD operations
Simple knowledge base management
Manual ticket assignment and status updates
Basic audit logging

Phase 2: AI Agent Integration
Goal: Automated triage with deterministic logic

Deterministic classification system (keyword-based)
Knowledge base search functionality
Response template generation
Basic confidence scoring
Auto-resolution workflow

Phase 3: Enhanced Intelligence
Goal: Improved AI capabilities and user experience

LLM integration for classification and response generation
Vector-based knowledge base search
Confidence threshold configuration
Enhanced audit trail visualization
Real-time notifications

Phase 4: Advanced Features
Goal: Production-ready scalability and monitoring

WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
SLA monitoring and breach detection
Feedback loops for AI improvement
Advanced analytics and reporting
Attachment processing capabilities

Logical Dependency Chain
Foundation Dependencies

Database Setup → User authentication → Role-based routing
Basic UI Framework → Authentication pages → Protected routes
API Infrastructure → CRUD endpoints → Data validation

Feature Build Order

Authentication System (blocking for all other features)
Knowledge Base Management (required for AI agent)
Basic Ticket Operations (core functionality)
Agent Workflow Infrastructure (triage pipeline)
AI Agent Integration (automation layer)
Agent Review Interface (human oversight)
Audit System Enhancement (observability)

Critical Path to Usability

User can log in and access appropriate views
Admin can manage knowledge base articles
User can create tickets that persist and are viewable
Basic ticket status updates work manually
AI agent can process tickets (even with stub logic)
Agents can review and modify AI suggestions

Assumptions & Constraints
Technical Assumptions

MongoDB for primary data storage
Redis available for job queuing if needed
Docker environment for deployment
Modern browser support (ES6+)

Business Constraints

48-hour development timeline for core functionality
